#What was changed and what stayed the same

for this homework, the assignment was code refractoring. The jist is to look through the code and "clean it up". Generally speaking, this is to simplify and condence the code as much as possible, while still having the same looking page. This included both the html and the css files. For the css, the general cleaning was turning div classes and id's into simplified elements when possible. Such as turning the <div class="footer"> into a simpler footer element. As for the css, the main cleaning was going though the code and connecting all the code that was the same into a single chunk of code. The biggest example being the "benefits" and "services".
